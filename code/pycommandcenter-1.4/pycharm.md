# Installing PyCommandCenter in PyCharm

Start by downloading the library from the [PyCommandCenter repository](https://gitlab.liu.se/starcraft-ai-course/pycommandcenter/-/tags).

Place the library in your repository.

Add the library to the Python path in Python by:

1. File->Settings->Project: (project name)->Project Interpreter.
2. Select the cog in the upper right corner and select "Show All".
3. In the new window that opens, select the icon which shows a few folders connected with lines.
4. In the new window, first press the plus icon, and then select the path of your repository (the path to where you placed the library).
5. Restart PyCharm with "File->Invalidate Caches/Restart->Invalidate and Restart".
